# Flyweight design pattern

- It allows programs to support vast quantities of objects by keeping their memory consumption low
- it is achieved by sharing parts of object state between multiple objects
  - thus allowing it to save RAM by caching the same data used by different objects

## When to use

- it has a single purpose, which is to minimize memory intake
  - thus it is not required if program doesn't struggle with a shortage of RAM
